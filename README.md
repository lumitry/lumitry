# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year student at RIT with a "learning new technologies" problem:

- Javascript
  - React
  - Angular
  - Svelte
  - TypeScript
- Java
  - Java Spring
  - Mockito
  - JUnit
- Python
  - Flask
  - Pytest
- SQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Sqlite
- Rust
  - Tauri

I have a project, myMedia, in the planning stages; I recently made the repo public! I'm considering switching the backend from Sqlite via Tauri to Pocketbase or some similar solution, to avoid writing a ton of messy Rust code (the stuff I've written thus far is admittedly bad, but I'm learning!).

I'm also working on my [personal site](briggstucker.com), which I'm writing in Next.js, which has been exciting to learn about especially given how prevalent it is.

Currently looking for Software Engineering Co-ops in the Summer and Fall of 2024, as well as Spring of 2025.
