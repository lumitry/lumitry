# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year student at RIT with a "learning new technologies" problem:

- Javascript (TypeScript, React, Next.js, Angular, Svelte + SvelteKit)
- Java (Spring, Mockito, JUnit5)
- Python (Flask-RESTful, Pytest)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, Sqlite)
- Rust (Tauri)
- Webhooks
- Selenium

I have a project, myMedia, in the planning stages; I recently made the repo public! I'm considering switching the backend from Sqlite via Tauri to Pocketbase or some similar solution, to avoid writing a ton of messy Rust code (the stuff I've written thus far is admittedly bad, but I'm learning!).

I'm also working on my [portfolio site](briggstucker.com), which I'm writing in Next.js, which has been exciting to learn about especially given how prevalent it is.

Currently looking for Software Engineering Co-ops in Spring of 2026.

Additionally, I have a few side projects that aren't currently on Github:

- Managing my home server/NAS (Ubuntu Server, docker-compose, Portainer, [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com), [ChangeDetection](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io), [firefly-iii](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii), Nextcloud, FreshRSS, Samba, et al.)
- Basic Python Flask server to receive a webhook POST from Gitea on new commits being pushed, pull the associated changes, then add/update those documents in the RAG database of an [Open-WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) instance
- Various scripts in JS for that interface with the [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin's API for the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) markdown editor to create custom "[views](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/)"
