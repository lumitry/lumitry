# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Don't mind me, I'm mostly using private repos âœ¨

Student at RIT currently learning SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite), Javascript (+ Svelte, React, TypeScript, Angular), Rust, Java (+ Spring), Python (+ Flask).

I have a project in the planning stages at the moment. Will make repo public when it's ready; I'm still deciding on my tech stack at the moment (was going to use MongoDB but SQLite seems better for my use case; might have to change from Rust backend to something else).
