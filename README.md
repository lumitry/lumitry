# Hi there 👋
Don't mind me, I'm mostly using private repos ✨

Student at RIT currently learning SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite), Javascript (+ Svelte, React, TypeScript, Angular), Rust (+ Tauri), Java (+ Spring), Python (+ Flask).

I have a project, myMedia, in the planning stages; I recently made the repo public! I'm considering switching the backend from Sqlite via Tauri to Pocketbase or some similar solution, to avoid writing a ton of messy Rust code (the stuff I've written thus far is admittedly bad, but I'm learning!).

I'm also working on my personal site, which I'm writing in Next.js, which has been exciting to learn about especially given how prevalent it is in the industry.

Currently looking for Software Engineering Co-ops in the Summer and Fall of 2024, as well as Spring of 2025.
